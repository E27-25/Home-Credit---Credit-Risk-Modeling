This is a **binary classification** problem.\n","\n","**Key Evaluation Metrics**\n","\n","1. **Accuracy:** \n","   - **Definition:** The proportion of correctly classified cases (both defaults and non-defaults).\n","   - **Reason:**  It's a general measure of the model's overall performance, but can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced (more non-defaults than defaults).\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","     accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_predicted)\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Precision:**\n","   - **Definition:** The proportion of predicted defaults that are actually defaults.\n","   - **Reason:**  Important for minimizing false positives (predicting a default when there is none), which could lead to unnecessary credit denials.\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import precision_score\n","     precision = precision_score(y_true, y_predicted)\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Recall (Sensitivity):**\n","   - **Definition:** The proportion of actual defaults that are correctly predicted.\n","   - **Reason:** Crucial for minimizing false negatives (failing to predict a default), which could result in financial losses for the bank.\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n","     recall = recall_score(y_true, y_predicted)\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **F1-Score:**\n","   - **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.\n","   - **Reason:**  Useful when you want to balance the trade-off between precision and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n","     f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_predicted)\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):**\n","   - **Definition:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between defaults and non-defaults across all probability thresholds. \n","   - **Reason:**  Provides a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance than a single threshold-based metric. It's particularly useful in imbalanced datasets.\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n","     auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_predicted_proba) # Use predicted probabilities for AUC \n","     ```\n","\n","6. **Gini Coefficient:**\n","   - **Definition:** Similar to AUC, it measures the model's discriminatory power, but it is scaled to a range of 0 to 1.\n","   - **Reason:**  Provides a normalized measure of the model's ability to separate the two classes, making it easier to compare models with different AUC values.\n","   - **Python Code:**\n","     ```python\n","     from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n","     gini = 2 * roc_auc_score(y_true, y_predicted_proba) - 1\n","     ```\n","\n","**Handling Imbalanced Data**\n","\n","Since financial datasets are often imbalanced, you need to consider techniques like:\n","\n","* **Upsampling:** Duplicating minority class samples to balance the dataset.\n","* **Downsampling:** Removing majority class samples to create a more balanced representation.\n","* **Weighted sampling:** Assigning different weights to samples during training to prioritize the minority class.\n","* **Using appropriate metrics:** Focus on metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score that are less affected by class imbalance.\n","\n","**Choosing the Right Metrics for Your Model**\n","\n","* **Business priorities:** If preventing false positives (unnecessary credit denials) is critical, prioritize **precision**. If catching all defaults (avoiding financial losses) is paramount, focus on **recall**.\n","* **Data characteristics:** If the dataset is imbalanced, rely on **AUC, Gini coefficient, and F1-score** to evaluate the model's performance more comprehensively.\n","* **Model complexity:**  For simpler models, **accuracy** can be a starting point, while more sophisticated models benefit from a deeper understanding of **precision, recall, and AUC.**\n","\n","**Example Use Case**\n","\n","Let's assume you've built a credit risk model and are evaluating its performance on a test set:\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score\n","\n","# ...

This mimics how the model will perform in the future.\n","* **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like time-series cross-validation to assess how the model performs on different time windows. This helps identify overfitting and ensures generalization.\n","* **Feature Engineering:**  Consider features that capture temporal trends (e.g., moving averages of payment history) to improve stability.\n","\n","**Recommended Approach:**\n","\n","1. **Start with all the metrics mentioned above to get a holistic view of the model's performance.**\n","2. **Focus on AUC and Gini for evaluating the model's discriminatory power.**\n","3. **Use time-based splits and cross-validation to ensure the model's stability over time.**\n","4. **Track the metrics regularly to monitor how the model's performance evolves with new data.**\n","\n","**By carefully choosing and applying these evaluation metrics, you can develop a credit risk model that accurately predicts defaults and remains robust over time.** \n","\n"]}],"source":["#50column\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')\n","response = model.generate_content(\"\"\"\"I want you to act as a data scientist in field credit Risk in bank financing. \n","I will give you a description of This dataset contains a large number of tables as a result of utilizing diverse data sources \n","and the varying levels of data aggregation used while preparing the dataset. and background information are Number of persons \n","with the same mobile phone number.,Total number of loan payments made by the client.,Average DPD (days past due) with tolerance \n","within the past 24 months from the maximum closure date, assuming that the contract is finished.
