Analyzing Home Credit Risk Predictions: A Deep Dive\n","\n","You've presented a fascinating dataset and a set of model predictions. As a world-class consultant, data analyst, and banker, I'm ready to help you understand these predictions and group them based on the underlying reasons. \n","\n","**Understanding the Data:**\n","\n","Before diving into the predictions, let's understand the features you've provided.  These features seem to fall into several categories:\n","\n","* **Credit History:** Credit price, number of loan payments, average DPD, number of credit applications rejected, number of months with incoming payments, maximum unpaid installments, interest rate, number of paid installments, maximum days past due, number of incoming payments, percentage of installments paid late, maximum days past due in last 3 months, monthly annuity amount, residual amount for active contract, number of outstanding installments for active contracts, total amount of active contracts, year when maximum DPD occurred, maximum days past due for a closed contract, categorization of clients by credit bureau, total amount of past due debt, maximal days past due for active contract, total amount of closed contracts, maximal past due amount for a closed contract, maximal overdue amount for a closed contract, total outstanding debt for active contracts, number of installments of the active contract, maximal past due amount for an active contract, number of active contracts in credit bureau, total amount of closed contracts, maximal past due amount for a closed contract, maximal overdue amount for a closed contract, total outstanding debt for active contracts, number of installments of the active contract, maximal past due amount for an active contract, number of active contracts in credit bureau.\n","* **Demographics:** Number of persons with the same mobile phone number, level of education, estimate of creditworthiness, district of registered address, education level, amount of main income, type of income, district of employer's address, house type, contact type.\n","* **Financial Activity:** Deposit amount, debit card turnover, average balance on debit card, debit card turnover for the last 30 days.\n","\n","**Analyzing the Predictions:**\n","\n","The model has assigned scores ranging from 0.0027 to 0.1325, indicating varying levels of risk. To understand these scores, we need to analyze the features associated with each case ID. \n","\n","**Grouping Predictions by Reason:**\n","\n","Here's a possible grouping of the predictions based on the features and their potential impact on risk:\n","\n","**Group 1: High Credit Utilization and Past Due Payments**\n","\n","* **Case IDs:** 4159, 5179, 4741, 12604, 1527, 13785, 10786, 16114, 1611\n","* **Reason:** These cases have a high number of active contracts, a significant amount of outstanding debt, and a history of past due payments. This suggests a high level of credit utilization and a potential inability to manage debt obligations.\n","* **Example:** Case ID 4159 has a score of 0.1325, the highest in the dataset. This case has a high number of active contracts, a large total outstanding debt, and a history of past due payments.\n","\n","**Group 2: Recent Credit Applications and Inquiries**\n","\n","* **Case IDs:** 17846, 2872, 702, 19301, 9114, 15762, 12015, 15956, 19881\n","* **Reason:** These cases have a high number of credit bureau inquiries in the recent past, indicating a potential need for additional credit or a pattern of applying for new credit. This could signal a financial strain or a desire to take on more debt.\n","* **Example:** Case ID 17846 has a score of 0.063, indicating a moderate risk. This case has a high number of credit bureau inquiries in the last 360 days, suggesting a recent increase in credit activity.\n","\n","**Group 3: Limited Credit History and Low Income**\n","\n","* **Case IDs:** 18344, 15898, 1456, 18211, 2907, 12418, 1773, 17615, 4733, 14529, 15659, 13820, 18205, 11957, 11106, 15886, 4292, 4339, 10052, 10143, 10503, 17884, 14405, 9125, 2524, 3494, 14019, 18254\n","* **Reason:** These cases have limited credit history, low income, or a combination of both. This makes it difficult for the model to assess their creditworthiness accurately.\n","* **Example:** Case ID 18344 has a score of 0.0202, indicating a low risk. This case has a limited credit history and a low income, making it difficult for the model to assess their risk accurately.\n","\n","**Group 4: Unknown Factors**\n","\n","* **Case IDs:**  Many cases have missing data for key features, making it difficult to determine the reason for the prediction.\n","* **Reason:** Missing data can significantly impact the model's ability to make accurate predictions. \n","\n","**Important Considerations:**\n","\n","* **Model Transparency:** It's crucial to understand the model's inner workings. What algorithms are used? How are features weighted? This information is essential for interpreting predictions and identifying potential biases.\n","* **Feature Engineering:** The quality of the features significantly impacts the model's performance. Are there any missing features that could be added? Can existing features be combined or transformed to improve their predictive power?\n","* **Data Quality:** Missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers can all affect the model's accuracy. Ensure the data is clean and reliable.\n","* **Business Context:**  The model's predictions should be interpreted within the context of the business. What are the specific risks the bank is trying to mitigate? How do these predictions align with the bank's overall risk appetite?\n","\n","**Next Steps:**\n","\n","1. **Investigate Missing Data:**  Address the missing data points in the dataset. This could involve imputation, removing cases with too much missing data, or collecting additional information.\n","2. **Feature Engineering:** Explore ways to improve the features. This could involve creating new features based on existing ones, transforming features, or using domain expertise to identify relevant features.\n","3. **Model Evaluation:**  Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. This could involve comparing the model's predictions to actual outcomes, analyzing the model's sensitivity to different features, and identifying potential biases.\n","4. **Business Alignment:**  Ensure the model's predictions are aligned with the bank's business objectives. This could involve discussing the model's limitations with stakeholders, developing strategies for managing risk based on the model's predictions, and monitoring the model's performance over time.\n","\n","By taking these steps, you can gain a deeper understanding of the model's predictions and use them to make informed decisions about credit risk management. \n","\n"]}],"source":["genai.configure(api_key='AIzaSyAgIrJfih28y01vZkRr16YPCN1aq_n3UXU')\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')\n","\n","messages = [\n","    {'role':'user',\n","     'parts': [\n","\"\"\"\n","My tabular data is tubular data about home credit risk from bank.

Analyzing Home Credit Risk Scores: A Deep Dive\n","\n","You've presented a fascinating dataset, and the model's output reveals some interesting patterns. Let's break down the reasons behind the predicted scores and group them accordingly.\n","\n","**Key Observations:**\n","\n","* **High Scores (0.1+):**  Case ID 19827 stands out with a significantly higher score (0.119). This suggests a higher risk of default.\n","* **Moderate Scores (0.03-0.1):**  Case IDs 6471, 19402, 8189, and 10242 fall into this category. These clients pose a moderate risk.\n","* **Low Scores (0.01-0.03):**  Case IDs 2295, 11405, 19655, 8168, and 10242 exhibit low risk scores.\n","\n","**Reasoning Behind the Scores:**\n","\n","To understand the model's predictions, we need to analyze the features contributing to each case's score. Here's a breakdown:\n","\n","**Group 1: High Risk (Score > 0.1)**\n","\n","* **Case ID 19827:**\n","    * **High Number of Credit Bureau Queries:**  This client has a significant number of queries in the last 360 days (5), indicating potential financial distress or a history of seeking credit.\n","    * **Rejected Credit Applications:**  The client has been rejected for credit applications in the past 9 months (1), suggesting potential creditworthiness issues.\n","    * **High Number of Unpaid Installments:**  The client has a history of unpaid installments (66), indicating a pattern of late payments.\n","\n","**Group 2: Moderate Risk (Score 0.03-0.1)**\n","\n","* **Case ID 6471:**\n","    * **High Number of Credit Bureau Queries:**  This client has a high number of queries in the last 360 days (10), suggesting potential financial instability.\n","    * **High Total Amount of Closed Contracts:**  The client has a significant amount of closed contracts (16042.8), indicating a history of borrowing.\n","* **Case ID 19402:**\n","    * **High Total Amount of Active Contracts:**  The client has a high total amount of active contracts (20000.0), indicating a significant financial burden.\n","    * **High Residual Amount for Active Contract:**  The client has a high residual amount for their active contract (1056640.5), suggesting a large outstanding debt.\n","* **Case ID 8189:**\n","    * **High Average DPD:**  The client has a high average DPD (730), indicating a history of significant delays in payments.\n","    * **High Maximum Days Past Due for Closed Contract:**  The client has a high maximum days past due for a closed contract (972), suggesting a history of significant payment issues.\n","* **Case ID 10242:**\n","    * **High Maximum Days Past Due for Closed Contract:**  The client has a high maximum days past due for a closed contract (1232), indicating a history of significant payment issues.\n","    * **High Total Amount of Closed Contracts:**  The client has a significant amount of closed contracts (46359.8), indicating a history of borrowing.\n","\n","**Group 3: Low Risk (Score 0.01-0.03)**\n","\n","* **Case IDs 2295, 11405, 19655, 8168, and 10242:**  These clients generally exhibit positive credit history with low DPD, few credit bureau queries, and limited outstanding debt.\n","\n","**Important Considerations:**\n","\n","* **Missing Data:**  The presence of \"None\" values in the dataset can impact the model's accuracy. Imputation techniques or feature engineering might be necessary to address missing data.\n","* **Feature Importance:**  Understanding the relative importance of each feature in the model's prediction is crucial. This can be achieved through feature importance analysis.\n","* **Model Validation:**  It's essential to validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., AUC, precision, recall) and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.\n","\n","**Recommendations:**\n","\n","* **Further Investigation:**  For high-risk cases, conduct a deeper investigation into their financial situation, credit history, and any potential red flags.\n","* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Implement risk mitigation strategies for moderate-risk cases, such as stricter credit limits, higher interest rates, or more frequent monitoring.\n","* **Targeted Marketing:**  Utilize the model's insights to target low-risk clients with tailored marketing campaigns and offers.\n","\n","**Conclusion:**\n","\n","By analyzing the features contributing to each case's score, we can gain valuable insights into the model's predictions and identify potential risk factors. This information can be used to improve risk management strategies, enhance customer segmentation, and optimize marketing efforts. Remember, continuous monitoring and model refinement are crucial for maintaining accurate and reliable risk assessments. \n","\n"]}],"source":["genai.configure(api_key='AIzaSyAgIrJfih28y01vZkRr16YPCN1aq_n3UXU')\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')\n","\n","messages = [\n","    {'role':'user',\n","     'parts': [\n","\"\"\"\n","My tabular data is tubular data about home credit risk from bank.
